# Select_Computational_Physics_problems

Select Problems from chapters 2, 4, 5, 7 and 10 from Computational Physics, 2nd Edition by Nicholas J. Giordano and Hisao Nakanishi- Department of Physics, Purdue University

This repository contains 5 long computational physics problems solved using Mathematica from first computational principles, so no vectorized calculations, all lists and demanding convoluted for loops and if statements, a real computational NIGHTMARE yet very rigorous and informative. I document below each chapter covered with a description of the tasks involved, then list every question and reproduced figure from the book. Each question will have its own folder, Mathematica notebooks will be provided per chapter and the figures added for quick access to reproduced figures for thosw who want to take a quick look at the output without downloading and running the code themselves.

## Computational Methods Used:

### Euler, Euler-Cromer, Jacobi relaxation Method, Random Walking Method, Shooting Method  

The questions tackle:

### 1.Chapter2: 

Kinematics with sophisticated drag mechanics including temperature and wind effects

#### The problems involved include:
Problem 1: question 2.4. for uphill and downhill motions.
Problem 2: Reproducing Fig. 2.7 for the cases
(a) no wind
(b) headwind
(c) tailwind.
(d) comparing output to NDSolve
Problem 3: question 2.7. 
(a) using the isothermal model to reproduce Fig. 2.5.
(b) using the adiabatic model to compare with the isothermal model.
(c) Taking theta = pi/4 to study the temperature effect on the kinematics for T = 250, 275, 300 and 325 K.
NB: I Compare using NDSolve whenever applicable in problem 3.
